## Deprecated

1. The `{{ content_for_index }}` object is no longer fuctional. This means that the `Add section` button will not appear in the customize section even if `{{ content_for_index }}` is used in the `index.liquid` file.

   ### Steps to Enable `Add section` Functionality

   To restore the `Add section` functionality, follow these steps:

   1. Rename or delete the `index.liquid` file:
      - Locate the `index.liquid` file in your project directory.
      - Rename it to something else (e.g., `index-deprecated.liquid`) or delete it entirely.
   2. Create a new `index.json` file.
      - In the same directory where the `index.liquid` file was located, create a new file named `index.json`.
   3. Create a json object with the following keys. `name`, `section`, and `order`.

      <details>
      <summary><strong>name</strong></summary>

      `name` key specifies the name of the object.

      </details>

      <details>
      <summary><strong>section</strong></summary>

      `section` key contains an object that defines the sections you want to display in the `Add section` button.

      </details>

      <details>
      <summary><strong>order</strong></summary>

      `order` key is an array that specifies the order of the keys in the `section` object.

      </details>

      #### Example Structure

      Here's an example structure of the `index.json` file:

      ```
      {
         "name": "Home page",
         "sections": {
         "hero-template" : {
                  "type": "hero"
               }
            },
         "order": ["hero-template"]
      }
